# Map_Traffic

An application that uses Azure and a REST API to add Incidents and their locations to a Azure Map, and displays more optimal routes from one point to another on USA's Map.
It is also possible to save the path points to a file and compare chosen paths to gain insights about the state of the road in terms of accidents, bottlenecks etc.
The data generated about different clients, the time and distination choices are potentially relevant for Data analytics.
